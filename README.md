# Minesweeper
Minesweeper The Default Game that comes with Microsoft Windows OS in CPP (Depriciated - Uses conio.h)
This was My Final Year Project for My 12th, and we were forced to use Turbo C++ without any graphic Libraries and had to work in just one file so crappy code.

Features:-
  Colourful - Upto Some Extent
  HighScores Can be stored - File handling Was Compulsory
  It Works!
